# House-Modeling
Focused on 3D house modeling using OpenGL for realistic rendering.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase a 3D house model rendered using OpenGL. It employs various libraries for different functionalities:

- **GLFW**: Used for creating windows, contexts, and handling inputs.
- **GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)**: Provides mathematical operations and functionalities commonly needed in graphics applications.
- **Dear ImGui**: Offers a user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with the rendering and modeling.
- **Assimp (Open Asset Import Library)**: Facilitates importing various 3D model formats into the application.

## Features

- **3D House Modeling**: Implementing a detailed house model with textures and lighting.
- **User Interface**: Integration of Dear ImGui for user-friendly controls and interactions.
- **Importing Models**: Utilizing Assimp to import various 3D model formats for expanded options.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later
